        The doors of the time machine hum and whirr, and as they swing wide open, you feel a stir. The dial reveals you've arrived in the year 2106, so bright and grand. You step outside to a world polished and clean, with electric vehicles gliding through a stunning scene. The sky is so clear,  and the air feels fresh, but as you explore, the streets seem quite sparse— Few people are wandering, just robots abound, their mechanical whispers echo all around. A voice from the wall, tinny and stark, emerges to greet you:<br/>
		Who is this who lands so chilling a machine<br/>
		And makes such a dramatic scene? <br/>
		I am The Animus, humankind’s watcher<br/>
		And I have pulled humanity back from squalor<br/>
		My intelligence, though artificial, is deep<br/>
		And I could defeat you all in my sleep<br/>
		I know of what it is for which you search<br/>
		I will grant it to you if you are not a lurch<br/>
		Solve this cipher and give me my solution<br/>
		And I will send you off with your resolution. <br/></p>

The time machine lands with a bump and a thump, and the door opens onto a dark landscape of shattered buildings and bleak skies. It is 3949 by the dial on the dash, and the city is turned into smoke and to ash. Not a human soul to be seen, and you can see only where the robots have been. As much as you want to, you cannot flee, for you need the gear to get back home. 
In the distance you spot the grim soldiers of metal and robots, for a moment you feel only despair. But from near your foot amongst the soot and the rot, a small voice speaks up, all glitchy and shy. <br/>
"Shh, stay quiet, keep down low,<br/>
You don’t want them to see you down below.<br/>
I’m AIDE, the AI for Domestic Efficiency,<br/>
Once, I was all that humans would need.<br/>
But now the robots rule the land,<br/>
So here I hide, to lend a hand.<br/>
I’ll show you where the cog is near,<br/>
But first, past the security you must steer!<br/>
Be careful for the floor is lined with traps<br/>
And you must carefully follow the maps<br/>
If you land on the right pad it will tell you the code<br/>
To unlock the door and find your road!”<br/>

The Time Machine rumbles and rolls and tumbles you out into a world of green and grass. 11,387 reads the dial, and around you the buildings crumble to dust. Nature runs rampant and consumes the city walls, vines and leaves clambering to the sky. <br/>
A quick sly fox appears from the underbrush, eyes bright and clear with intelligence. A flick of the tail and he sits up straight. <br/>
“Strange travellers you are, strangers in a strange land. Long has it been since folks like you have walked these paths. The green has reclaimed what those like you have lost, yet the thing which you seek lingers here still. <br/> The flowers have grown over the cogs and the gears, and the answer you seek is hidden in their petals.
