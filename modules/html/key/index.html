   <h1>Main Key</h1>
   <h1>The sequences</h1>
   <p>The sequences were made to avoid groups that start at the same time all following each other around the library<br>
     each id has a different sequence for the puzzles as outlined below.<br><br>

     For this escape room the first five puzzles are in different sequences <br>
     and the sixth puzzle is always at the end followed by the finish and feedback pages.<br><br>

     below are the sequence orders:
   <h1>Sequence 1</h1>
     <p>
       {1,2,3,4,5}
     </p>
   <h1>Sequence 2</h1>
     <p>
       {5,4,1,2,3}
     </p>
   <h1>Sequence 3</h1>
     <p>
        {2,1,5,3,4}
     </p>
   <h1>Sequence 4</h1>
     <p>
       {3,5,4,1,2}
     </p>
   <h1>Sequence 5</h1>
     <p>
        {4,3,2,5,1}
     </p>
   <h1>Sequence 6</h1>
     <p>
       {1,5,3,4,2}
     </p>
     <p>Feel free to use this code to create your own escape room.<br>
        it's very messy and could do with a javascript/css clean up so go ahead and messabout</p>
    <h1>Happy escaping!!</h1>
